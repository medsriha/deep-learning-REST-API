# Deep_learning_REST_API
Kears Deep Learning scalable REST API.

Very straitforward deep learning REST API that wraps a Keras model in an efficient, scalable manner. The REST API is capable of batch processing images, scaling to multiple machines including multiple web servers and Redis instances, and round-robin scheduling when placed behind a load balancer. Submitting inference requests to the API endpoint using both cURL and Python.
